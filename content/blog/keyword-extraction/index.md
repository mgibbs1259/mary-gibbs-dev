Effective job descriptions rely on strategically chosen keywords to bridge the gap between employer expectations and candidate qualifications. Tailoring your resume by incorporating the most important keywords increases the likelihood of grabbing a potential employer's attention to land an interview. Teal streamlines this process by offering automated keyword extraction and matching in their platform.
